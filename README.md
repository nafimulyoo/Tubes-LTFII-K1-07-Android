# MeArm Controller by K1-07 LTF II
Welcome to the MeArm Controller, a project developed by the K1-07 LTF II team for their final project in the Physics Engineering Lab II at the Bandung Intitute of Technology. This innovative device has three modes designed to make controlling the MeArm with ease.

## Three Modes of Operation
The MeArm Controller has three modes of operation to choose from:
1. Canvas Mode
2. D-Pad Mode
3. Joystick Mode

### Canvas Mode
In this mode, the user can use the canvas to control the MeArm by drawing a path for it to follow. This mode is perfect for those who want to experiment with more creative movements.

### D-Pad Mode
The D-Pad mode allows the user to control the MeArm using directional buttons. This mode is perfect for precise movements and straightforward control.

### Joystick Mode
In joystick mode, the user can control the MeArm using a joystick. This mode is perfect for those who want a more traditional control experience.
